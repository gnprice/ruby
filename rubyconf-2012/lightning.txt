Sketch of lightning talk:

I'm going to talk about a problem, and some progress toward a
solution.

Ruby is really slow to start up.

 (slide:  (All light-on-black.)
   Problem: Ruby startup time
 )

And by Ruby I mean MRI; though if you've used JRuby you know that JVM
startup is no picnic either.  So an app running on MRI can be really
slow to start up.  Here's the Rails app that is our frontend at
Solano Labs:

 (slide: (with 1.9.2-p290; better perh. to redo with latest)
   $ date; bundle exec rails c
   Mon Oct 29 18:26:11 PDT 2012
   Time.now
   [waiting, waiting...]
 )

and I would stand here and move on precisely as soon as the prompt
would come up, but that would take much too long in a lightning talk.
It's about 36 seconds.

 (slide:
   [same, and then]
   Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.17)
   irb(main):001:0> Time.now
   => 2012-10-29 18:26:47 -0700
 )

That really bites when you're trying to get work done.


So let's profile.

 ['perf report' output from latest release; and summarize with
  1-3 percentages]

benchmark, pure require

follow logic of profiles, but I believe then index

then cache

then discuss what's left (mostly GC)
